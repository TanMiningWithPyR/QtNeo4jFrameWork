## PyQt5
Qt5 is set of cross-platform C++ libraries that implement high-level APIs for accessing many aspects of modern desktop and mobile systems. These include location and positioning services, multimedia, NFC and Bluetooth connectivity, a Chromium based web browser, as well as traditional UI development.
PyQt5 is a comprehensive set of Python bindings for Qt v5. It is implemented as more than 35 extension modules and enables Python to be used as an alternative application development language to C++ on all supported platforms including iOS and Android.

## Neo4j
Neo4j is one of the popular Graph Databases and Cypher Query Language (CQL). Neo4j is written in Java Language. In Neo4j, data is persisted as nodes and relationships.

## Object-oriented
As we know, contemporary mean for software design is object-oriented and python is an absolute object-oriented language. When designing an APP, an SQL database is considerd. But the data modelling of SQL database is not object-oriented. So usually we use ORM to map object into data table, such as SQLAlchemy. 

For my perspective, we can map Python's objects and Python's relationship between objects into Neo4j's nodes and relationships directly. Then we unify the methodology in one software designing no matter what on client, server or db.
